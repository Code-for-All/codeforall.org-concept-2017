      <p>There are three ways to participate:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Access our online <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/library/">resources</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools">toolkits.</a></li>
        <li>Participate in the <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade">Code for America Brigade network</a>. The Code for America Brigade network is open to members from outside the US. International Brigade chapters can join as Brigade Network Members. <b>More information and a sign up form </b>can be found on the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize">Brigade website</a>).</li>
        <li>Become an institutional partner member of Code for All. If you are an established institution in your home country and want to join Code for All as an official partner organization, send an email with more information about your work to international [at] codeforamerica.org.  If this level of engagement is of interest to you, but you're at the front end of your organizing journey, starting a Brigade is a great first step towards joining the Code for All network (see option 2).</li>
