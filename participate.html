      <h2><font color="black">Are you interested in joining the Code for All Network?</font></h2>
      <p>Great! There are three ways you can participate:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>You can always access our online <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/library/"><b><u><font color="black">resources</font></b></u></a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/tools"><b><u><font color="black">
and organizing toolkits.</font></b></u></a></li><br>
        <li>If you are the first Code for All organizer in your country or city, we would love to help you get started!  <br>
        <br>
        <b>First,</b> join us as a <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade"><b><u><font color="black">Code for America Brigade Network Member</font></b></u></a>. 
        <br>
        As a Network Brigade Member you can participate in all of our communication channels and attend our online programs which are rich with resources that can help get your group off the ground. More information about Brigades can be found on the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/about"><b><u><font color="black">Brigade website</font></b></u></a>.</li>
        <br>
        <b>Second,</b> after you have spent some time building and growing, you can join us as an Institutional Code for All Partner.
        <br>The main ingredients include: more volunteers, more organizers, and more local collaborators! Gaining solid local government relationships as well as potential funders are prerequisites to joining Code for All - and starting off as a Code for America Brigade can help you get there.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>On the Brigade website you can see if there is already an Brigade or Code for All Partner near you. If there is, join in! 

          <li>If not, please fill out the form on the Brigade website so we can send you an email with organizing resources.</li>
          <br>
          <center><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/brigade/organize" class="button" color="teal">Brigade Website</a></center>
        </ul>
        <li>If you have been organizing for a while, and already have a steady member base of volunteers, co-organizers, government stakeholders, and funders, you, too can become a Partner of Code for All. <br>
        <br>As an established institution in your home country we invite you to reach out to international [at] codeforamerica.org to tell send us more about your work.</li>
