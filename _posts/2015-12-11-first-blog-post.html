<p>You might have noticed that we've revamped the Code for All site to include a blog so that we can share stories of civic innovation from around the world.</p>
<p>As Code for All starts its fourth year, we want to be more proactive in helping to share what we'veÂ achieved.</p>
<p>We'll also be inviting people from Code for All Partners to write to the blog as well.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can follow us on our <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeforAll">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/letscodeforall/">Facebook</a> pages!</p>
