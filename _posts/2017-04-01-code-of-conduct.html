<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Code for All community expects that Code for All network activities, events, and digital forums:</span></p>
<!--more-->
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as “yes/and”, not “no/but.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Members of the community reserve the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for All network activities, events, and digital forums.</span></p>
<p>Code for All is a non-partisan non-political organization and it will not be associated with any political party.  <span style="font-weight:400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for All creates open source products. No contributor who participated in a project can be the owner of the end result.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight:400;">This is based on </span><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct/"><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for America’s CoC</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and Code for Romania’s CoC.</span></em></p>
