<p>Code for South Africa is a non-profit that promotes informed decision making by using data, tools and tech to drive social change.  The group works mainly with media, civil society, communities, and government and has a team of ten people.</p>

<p>The team is based out of Claremont, South Africa and is in it's second year. They work out of the CodeBridge co-working space which is <a href="http://www.codebridge.co.za/" target="_blank"><em>literally under a bridge</em></a>.</p>
<p>Code for South Africa doesn't do hackathons, but rather data quests as they feel that hackathons tend to get too technical. During these data quests, they get together and tell stories using data.</p>
<p>Here's Code for South Africa's lead technologist to explain:</p>

<p>One of their projects was working with <a href="http://www.blacksash.org.za/" target="_blank">Black Sash</a> - an anti-apartheid and social justice organization. The team put together a tool to monitor social service payouts from the state. The team also worked with Black Sash to engage the community about the user experience of receiving state payouts. They were then able to go back to their government partner and get the two sides to talk and find ways to improve the process.</p>
<p>Another big impact the Code for South Africa had was the creation of the Living Wage Calculator to help people make informed decision about how much to pay domestic workers.</p>

<p>Another project that Code for South Africa is involved in is digital literacy by training community service organizations in working with data. Most of the projects that Code for South Africa produces have some sort of community service organization involvement.</p>
<p>This year, Code for South Africa will be running a data journalism school as well.</p>
