<p><a href="http://www.codeforaustralia.org/" target="_blank">Code for Australia</a> is a passionate and skilled community that works with government to develop tech-based solutions to solve civic-problems. Through their work, Code for Australia believes they can lend not only their voices, but their hands to drive collaboration and transparency, accelerate economic growth and reanimate citizenship.</p>

<p>Code for Australia is led by a managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/alvaromaz" target="_blank">Alvaro Maz</a>, community organizing director <a href="https://twitter.com/_jakelindsay" target="_blank">Jacob Lindsay</a>, and technical maestro <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdaloosii" target="_blank">Chris D'Aloisio</a>.</p>
<p>Code for Australia has three main programs that they use to help government. Here's Alvaro to explain:</p>

<h3>Melbourne Data</h3>
<p>The first program is their Fellowship program. <a href="http://stevebennett.me/" target="_blank">Steve Bennet</a> is Code for Australia's data guru in residence and worked with the City of Melbourne to help populate a data portal that was going to be used primarily for research purposes. While doing that <a href="http://melbdataguru.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Steve blogged about his experiences</a> and helped to create <a href="http://melbourne.yuri.io/" target="_blank">Melbourne.yuri.io</a> - a site that helps people access interesting data from the city even if they are not familiar with working with data.</p>
<h3>GovHack</h3>
<p>Another program that Code for Australia supports is <a href="https://www.govhack.org/" target="_blank">GovHack</a> - ran in part by Code for Australia's <a href="http://www.codeforaustralia.org/blog/life-as-a-coder-girl-guest-post-by-ruth-pearson" target="_blank">Coder Girls</a>. Gov Hack is an annual hackathon focused on government. GovHack has grown from a small event in 2009, to a volunteer run and community driven annual event! It grew from a 2 city event in 2012, an 8 city event in 2013 and a national 11 city event with over 1300 participants and observers in 2014! This year, GovHack went international with cities in New Zealand joining the event.</p>
<h3>Incubator Projects</h3>
<p>Code for Australia is also worked to help incubate several apps to help support the work of government. The teams worked with a number of local government on civic technology projects including helping the New South Wales Department of Education to create a better way to help parents find public schools, an <a href="http://rhinos.io/" target="_blank">app to help people become aware of nearby rhinos</a>.</p>
