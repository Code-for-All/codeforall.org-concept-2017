We’ve been meeting Code for Canada folks at civic tech conferences for some time now. Apart from connecting existing civic tech community groups in Canad, and helping to start new ones, they’ve also launched an exciting fellowship program in a partnership with various Canadian governments.

__Today we are pleased to welcome Code for Canada as a governing partner of the Code for All Network.__

Code for Canada launched in April 2017, and they’re working hard to deliver three different initiatives:

*   Fellowship Program – embedding digital professionals inside government so they can use their skills for social impact

*   Civic Tech Community Program – helping to build and grow this community in Canada

*   Education and Training Program – building public servants’ digital skills to help them integrate technology in their work
