<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Code for All is a trusted global network of civic tech organizations. Becoming a governing or affiliate partner of the network is a relationship-building process that can take multiple weeks or months. The process for partnership is outlined below. We invite everyone, partners or non-partners, to join in online discussion through our Slack channel, collaborate with us, meet us at events or invite us to your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Please don’t hesitate to contact us.</span></p>
<h2>Governing Partners</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The governing partners of Code for All are comprised of the partners in the organization who make decisions about the network’s strategy, activities and growth.

<p><span style="font-weight:400;">New applicants desiring to become a governing partner of Code for All will be evaluated by current governing partners based on the applicant’s level of organizational maturity. Potential Code-for partners exist along a spectrum from individuals or small groups of volunteers to institutions with a track record of work in this field and significant resources. The criteria for becoming a governing partner of Code for All include country-level or regional organizations that have:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">attained legal non-profit status, affiliation with an existing non-profit organization, or are measurably working towards establishing a sustainable institutional structure, depending on each country’s context;</span></li>

</ul>
<h2>Affiliate Partners</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This is a new category of partnership as of January 2017. Most organizations or groups of individuals who want to join the Code for All community may not be ready for membership as a governing partner.  However, many may share the Code for All mission and wish to be affiliated with the network. Affiliate partners may include, for example, groups of volunteers (“Brigades”) who are working toward goals in alignment with the Code for All mission, established subnational or local organizations that may not have a national affiliate, or new organizations that are not yet fully functional, but aspire to one day become a governing partner of the Code for All network. All organizations considered for governing partner status after January 2017 should have first been accepted as affiliate partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Affiliate partners will be listed on the Code for All website, benefit from additional access to Code for All members and resources and can identify as affiliates in their external communications.  In order to be accepted as affiliate partners, organizations will, in most cases, have: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">been nominated or recommended by a current Code for All partner;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">implemented or are implementing at least one project that conforms to the mission and values of Code for All;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">shown a willingness and desire to participate in Code for All activities, including in person and online;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">demonstrated that they have established relationships with either government or civil society partners that are necessary to achieving the mission of a Code-for partner; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">agreed to Code for All’s code of conduct.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Process for Consideration of New Affiliate Partners</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">A representative of the applying organization fills out the application form linked on the Code for All website.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The partnership committee reviews the application and contacts the organization to determine whether an applying organization is eligible to become an affiliate partner based on established criteria.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Affiliate partners are notified of their acceptance, deferral or denial within four weeks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Accepted affiliates provide their logo and URL for listing on the Code for All website.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Process for Consideration of New Governing Partners</h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Every quarter, affiliate partners are given the opportunity to indicate interest in applying as a governing partner of Code for All. During these windows, interested affiliates send an email indicating interest to the Code for All secretariat. The application process includes the following steps and should typically not take longer than eight weeks:</span>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The Code for All secretariat will respond to applicants who are determined to meet the established criteria for membership as a governing partner to organize an initial interview call with a member of the partnership committee. This committee member will serve as the applicant’s point of contact throughout the consideration process. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The applicant’s point of contact will take the lead in conducting a review of the organization to ensure that the organization meets the criteria for being a governing partner.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Based on this review, the Applicant’s point of contact will deliver initial recommendations to the full partnership committee on whether the applicant should be considered for membership as a governing partner. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The partnership committee may request any additional information that might assist in the decisionmaking process. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Applicants that meet the established criteria and are recommended for full membership as a governing partner by the partnership committee are put to a vote before the all governing partners of Code for All. Affirmative decisions must be made unanimously by those governing partners that choose to vote. Any objections raised should be resolved. </span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Applicants receive additional instructions on whether they’ve been accepted for full membership as a governing partner, deferred or denied. New governing partners will be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Code for All network.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Partnership Committee</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A committee composed of representatives from current governing partners of Code for All who have been good-standing members for at least a year will be charged with evaluating new candidates for partnership. The committee will meet on demand, as applications for partnership are received. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">The partnership committee currently consists of representatives from the Code for All secretariat, Code for America, Code for Germany, Code for Mexico, Code for Poland. Participation in the committee is voluntary and any governing partner is welcome to join.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The partnership committee will also be responsible for ensuring that existing partners continue to abide by the terms of the memorandum of understanding and meet the criteria membership. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Any substantial violations of the Code for All code of conduct or extended periods of inactivity will lead to an immediate review of membership.</span></p>
