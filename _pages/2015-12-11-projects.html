<p>Code for All Partners build civic technology projects that support their government and improve their communities.</p>
<p>Highlights from these projects include:</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/08/07/using-technology-to-help-displaced-residents-in-namie-japan/">Code for Japan / Code for Namie </a></h3>
<p>By harnessing existing tools and starting a Code for America-inspired Fellowship program, Code for Japan, and its subsidiary Code for Namie, are working to find ways to use technology to help people connect and overcome Namie’s recent challenges in ways that would have proven impossible in a different, less technologically-advanced time. Here is the first chapter of this journey.</p>
<h3><a href="http://codefor.de/en/stadtgeschichten/1tal-o-mat/%20">Code for Germany</a></h3>
<p>A round-up of local stories can be found on their <a href="http://codefor.de/en/stadtgeschichten/">English site</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://codeforthecaribbean.org/content/who-stole-my-cow-open-data-and-praedial-larceny%20">Code for Caribbean</a></h3>
<p>Over the last three years RADA has collaborated with the Mona School of Business &amp; Management, the Caribbean Open Institute, and the SlashRoots Foundation to publish agriculture open data through APIs and develop a number of proof of concept applications and visualizations to improve extension services and policy making. They have also participated in Developing The Caribbean, a regional open data conference and code sprint that spanned 6 islands this year, where they released data and helped define problem statements to development challenges, along with government agencies from across the Caribbean. The event attracted over 180 developers and generated over 25 prototypes in response to 30 problem statements.</p>
<h3>Codeando Mexico</h3>
<p>Codeando México was founded in 2013 and was spun off from the work being done with Codeando por America Latina. One of their first projects was working to build a better app to monitor activity in San Lazaro. The government had signed a contract to build one for 115 million pesos ($7.5 Million US) - when the actual app could have been built for around 500,000 pesos. (Just over $34,000 US).</p>
