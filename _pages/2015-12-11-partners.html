<h3><a href="https://codeforafrica.org/"><span style="color:#000000;">Code for Africa</span></a></h3>
<p>The continent is made up of one billion people living in 54 nations with wide variation in economic and government systems, with further differentiation by language, religion, and shared history. <em>Code for Africa</em> operates as a federation of autonomous country-based digital innovation organisations that support ‘citizen labs’ in nine countries and major projects in a further 15 countries.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org"><span style="color:#000000;">Code for America</span></a></h3>
<p>Code for America believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century.</p>
<p>We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.codeforaustralia.org/">Code for Australia</a></h3>
<p>Code for Australia believes government can work for everyone, and to do so it needs to become a platform that allows citizens, public servants and industry to come together and work on civic issues. The organisation has three programs to build, test and run civic technology, and in return, create a civic-technology ecosystem in Australia.<br />
The organisation has three programs:</p>
<p>We focus on:<br />
<b>Transparency</b> - as advocates and users of open data<br />
<b>Collaboration</b> - developing new ways to address old problems<br />
<b>Using technology</b> - leveraging the latest technologies and the crowd-sourcing game</p>
<h3><a href="http://codefor.ca/">Code for Canada</a></h3>
<p>Code for Canada , founded in 2017, works to build a more prosperous, sustainable, and equitable Canada, driven by improved policy and citizen engagement, and enabled through civic technology and design.</p>
<p>The nonprofit organization offers three programs: a fellowship that embeds digital professionals into government where they can work on the things that matter to Canadians; a community network that fosters the formation and growth of civic tech community groups in cities across the country; and a suite of education and training workshops that help governments, community groups and entrepreneurs use technology, data and design for the public good.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://codefor.de/">Code for Germany</a></span></h3>
<p>Code for Germany is a program by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany. The goal of the program is to promote developments in transparency, open data, and civic technology in Germany. The program started in February 2014 with the founding of Open Knowledge Labs in eight cities. The Labs are regional groups of designers, developers, journalists, and civic tech enthusiasts that meet regularly in order to use open data to create useful applications for citizens. The community develops apps, informs society about the value of open data, and helps local governments to become more transparent. In the meantime, the network has grown to over 25 Labs and consists of over 300 volunteers.</p>
<h3><a href="http://code4japan.org/">Code for Japan</a></h3>
<p>Code for Japan is connecting citizens and governments. For supporting citizens, we are building local Code for communities. On the government side, we are running fellowship program for changing the government from inside of it.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a style="color:#000000;" href="http://www.codeforthecaribbean.org/">Code for the Caribbean</a></span></h3>
<p>A Caribbean first, the pilot CftC Fellowship offers 3 part-time positions for a 6 month period. Fellows will work alongside RADA to explore inventive solutions for combating praedial larceny, one of the leading problems plaguing the Jamaican agricultural industry. By collaborating with stakeholders within and outside the Ministry, Fellows will build at least one application designed to address this problem area.</p>
<p>This pilot is fully-funded, and chosen Fellows will receive a stipend for their work.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a style="color:#000000;" href="http://www.codefor.nl/">Code for the Netherlands</a></span></h3>
<p>Governments and authorities are facing major challenges. Citizens want to be informed and be able to use innovative services. Code for NL joins a global network of civic innovators who use technology to strengthen governments and increase citizen participation. Code for NL puts innovative people with technical skills within (semi) governments to work on concrete solutions to social problems. In a program of one year these fellows work closely with all stakeholders surrounding the problem; they involve citizens, civil society organizations and government officials and use technology in a practical way.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://labcd.mx/">Laboratorio para la Ciudad</a> </span></h3>
<p>Laboratorio para la Ciudad (Laboratory for the City) is Mexico City’s experimental office for civic innovation and urban creativity, the first city government department of its kind in Latin America. The Lab is a space for rethinking, reimagining, and reinventing the way citizens and government can work together towards a more open, more livable and more imaginative city.</p>
<p>Mexico City’s Lab for the City was founded as a creative think-tank and experimental space for the government of Mexico City - the first of its kind at the city level in Latin America that brings together stakeholders within the civic tech space. It is the product of a partnership between an ambitious new Mayor and citizens committed to harnessing innovation to positively impact their city. The Lab’s primary staff is comprised of a multidisciplinary team of 20 people (artists, architects, urban planners, journalists, designers, historians, sociologists, techies, economists, etc.) and officially launched in June 2013. Working in a studio-like manner, the Lab environment fostered creativity and collaboration with an overarching strategy articulated as “provocations.”</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://codeforpakistan.org/">Code for Pakistan</a></span></h3>
<p>We are a tech non-profit that’s creating a non-partisan civic innovation ecosystem aiming to improve quality of life across Pakistan. Through the creation of open source technology to address civic needs, we strive to transform civic life by increasing civic engagement, encouraging the opening of government data, and supporting innovation in the public domain.</p>
<p>Trust in civic institutions has eroded in Pakistan, and too many of our fellow citizens view government as bureaucratic, corrupt, and inefficient -- or worse, as something that stifles progress rather than as a potential force for good. Collaboration between citizen tech developers and domain experts in local governments can create civic solutions and enhance civic life. This starts to reframe the relationship between local government and citizens, which is essential if the two are to live together smartly towards building a progressive Pakistan.</p>
<h3><a href="https://codeforpoland.org">Code for Poland</a> (ePanstwo Foundation)</h3>
<p>We believe we can achieve our vision for Poland by consciously working towards implementing technology solutions.</p>
<p>We know that the technology offers new possibilities for action, but not a panacea for all problems. Therefore we have created a space for discussion and cooperation to allow us all to work out optimal solutions. We build on the understanding of human interaction and social processes and try to deploy technological solutions where they will have the greatest positive impact.</p>
<p>Together we discuss, motivate to action, build the knowledge base and deploy applications and websites. Code for Poland is a program of ePanstwo Foundation.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><a href="http://code4.ro/in-english/">Code for Romania</a></span></h3>

<h3><a href="http://g0v.tw/en-US/"><span style="color:#000000;">Code for Taiwan (g0v)</span></a></h3>
<p>g0v.tw is an online community that pushes information transparency, focusing on developing information platform and tools for the citizens to participate in society. Substituting the “o” with “0″ in gov, the new “g0v” not only stands for rethinking the role that the government plays from the bottom up, but also represents the world view of 0 and 1 in the digital natives generation. Based on the spirit of open source, g0v cares about freedom of speech and open data, writing code to provide citizens the easy-to-use information service. The transparency of information can help citizens to have a better understanding on how the government works, to understand the issues faster and to avoid media monopoly, so they can monitor the government more efficiently, and become involved in actions and finally deepen the quality of democracy.</p>
