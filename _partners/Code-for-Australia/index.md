Code for Australia believes government can work for everyone, and to do so it needs to become a platform that allows citizens, public servants and industry to come together and work on civic issues. The organisation has three programs to build, test and run civic technology, and in return, create a civic-technology ecosystem in Australia

## Program Description

Code for Australia believes government can work for everyone, and to do so it needs to become a platform that allows citizens, public servants and industry to come together and work on civic issues. The organisation has three programs to build, test and run civic technology, and in return, create a civic-technology ecosystem in Australia.


The organisation focuses on:

- __Transparency__ - as advocates and users of open data
- __Collaboration__ - developing new ways to address old problems
- __Using technology__ - leveraging the latest technologies and the crowd-sourcing game

## Founding Story

Alvaro Maz met Dan Groch and Jacob Lindsay in 2013 after enrolling in an entrepreneurship fellowship course in Melbourne. Shortly after and inspired by Code for America, they decided to translate the model into Australia while building their own startups. In late 2014, Alvaro became the Executive Director and created a management team and a Board of advisors where both Jacob and Dan sit.

To date, the organisation has run six Fellowships, one Incubator and one Civic Lab in Melbourne.
