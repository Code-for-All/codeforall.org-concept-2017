Code for Europe supports Code For organizations cooperating at the European level.
<!--more-->

Code for Europe is a network of developers, designers and other ICT professionals that create digital services for communities and cities.

We do this in order to solve real, human problems in a reusable, flexible and inclusive way. We empower local communities to build, share and adapt civic tech. We solve local challenges by profiting from the shared experience of an international network of likeminded fellows.
