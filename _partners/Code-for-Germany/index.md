## Program Description

Code for Germany is a program of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany. It is
aimed towards fostering innovation, civic tech and transparency in Germany. At
its core lies a community program with more than 300 volunteer developers,
designers and journalists in 20 cities, that are organized in so-called
“Open Knowledge Labs”. They meet on a regular basis to tackle specific
challenges of their city and build close ties to the local government officials
and institutions. The OK Labs serve as hubs of civic innovation, developing apps
and building tools for fellow citizens. The goal is to inform society about the
benefits of open data and to make public institutions more effective and
transparent.

## Founding Story
Inspired by Code for America’s Brigades model, Code for Germany was launched in
February 2014 as a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany.


Before Code for Germany’s inception, the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany – as
an active player in open data and civic tech – had already been raising awareness
about open data, in part, through a series of national hackathons. While these
events brought together highly qualified and engaged citizens, a clear need was
identified to connect participants in their own local contexts in order to effect
sustainable change with a more long-standing impact. At the same time, German
cities began releasing public datasets, but coordinated efforts to transform
government-held data into citizen-centred services and applications still lagged
behind. By leveraging an existing network of civic developers, government change
agents and open data enthusiasts, a growing civic tech community was cultivated,
and its organizing force – Code for Germany was born.


In one year, the Code for Germany has expanded from 8 cities to 20 across the
Federal Republic. These local communities are made up of 300 volunteers that have
put in more than 15.000 hours of civic hacking. A variety of apps and projects
have been developed, from transforming municipal information systems into more
democratic digital spaces, to improving access to pre-school education. Together,
these local groups have fostered demand for more data, opening up an active
dialogue between data users and city governments.
