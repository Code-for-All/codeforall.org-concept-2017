Code for Poland is an interdisciplinary community seeking technological solutions to civic challenges.

## Program Description

Our vision is Poland as a country with efficient public institutions being
citizen-centric, companies focused on social issues operating on public data,
progressive NGOs knowing how to advocate with data, with citizens involving
themselves more in public matters and finally with dialogue that builds trust
among all of these actors.

We believe that wise use of technology can help to achieve such state in Poland. We have divided our actions in three areas of action:

* __Advocate__ - create dialogue with public institutions and NGOs, recommend them
progressive open solutions like open data platforms and publishing procurement
info, stimulate integration with various partners.
* __Create__ - build innovative social prototypes, applications and services. Repeat successes with deployment in other cities/areas.
* __Discuss__ - participate in discussions on our forum, on conferences. Propose new ideas, debate ones published by others.

We act in mentioned areas through the network of formally confirmed partners - mostly local NGOs and hackerspaces, but also companies and city offices.


## Founding Story

Since 2010 ePa≈Ñstwo Foundation has been a leader in creating technological tools
to support democracy and access to public information in Poland. We believe that
new technologies should serve not only business but also empowerment of citizens.
We believe that using tech skills for social benefit is a modern way of patriotism
and should be promoted as such. We build a great product - it started as a
parliamentary monitoring website and grew into the biggest repository of
public data in Poland with various apps build on the data. At that point we
felt ready to build a community of like-minded people to spread the idea of
Coding for Poland. Than we discovered that there is Code for America and thanks
to contact with CfA we gained a lot of inspiration on how to organise our
community work.
