Governments and authorities are facing major challenges. Citizens want to be
informed and be able to use innovative services. Code for NL joins a global
network of civic innovators who use technology to strengthen governments and
increase citizen participation.

## Mission

Code for NL puts innovative people with technical skills within (semi) governments
to work on concrete solutions to social problems. In a program of one year these
fellows work closely with all stakeholders surrounding the problem; they involve
citizens, civil society organizations and government officials and use technology
in a practical way.

## Program Description

Code for NL has emerged from the Code for Europe project that the city of
Amsterdam and Waag Society participated in over the past three years. Because
the ideas behind the movement gained so much support we felt it was the right
time to promote the fellowship idea beyond Amsterdam.

Currently we have three government bodies interested in running a fellowship
this year: the City of Amsterdam, the City of Eindhoven and the Province of
Groningen. Waag Society is responsible for setting up Code for NL, but we are
looking for partners to help us spread the ideas and values.
