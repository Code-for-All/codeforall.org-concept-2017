    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>Code for Germany is an active network of volunteer developers, designers and engaged citizens who meet in cities all over Germany to build digital tools and visualizations that help to improve their neighborhoods and cities.<br><br>

    The program set out to answer three questions: How can community life in Germany be improved? How can collaborative approaches enabled by new technologies make significant contributions? How can city governments leverage external know-how to become more citizen-centric, transparent, and efficient?<br>

    By tackling these questions, Code for Germany aims to contribute to an IT-based German government administration landscape that offers comprehensive digital services to its citizens. By deepening cooperation between city governments and local civic tech communities, Code for Germany hopes to sustain long-lasting partnerships among all residential stakeholders.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    OK Labs serve as hubs of civic innovation, developing apps and building tools for fellow citizens. The goal is to inform society about the benefits of open data and to make public institutions more effective and transparent. The community explores the possibilities of technology to improve urban life, and shows what's possible with open data. This creates an incentive for governments not just to open up their data but also to rethink the way in which they govern. In cooperation with the German Ministry for Education and Research, Code for Germany will have a special focus on Citizen Science projects in 2015. Four OK Labs will participate in the “Hack Your City” project, which bridges scientific institutions and citizen researchers with local civic tech communities to build tools and apps that tackle city problems. </p>

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>Inspired by Code for America’s Brigades model, Code for Germany was launched in February 2014 as a project of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany. 

    Before Code for Germany’s inception, the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany – as an active player in open data and civic tech – had already been raising awareness about open data, in part, through a series of national hackathons. While these events brought together highly qualified and engaged citizens, a clear need was identified to connect participants in their own local contexts in order to effect sustainable change with a more long-standing impact. At the same time, German cities began releasing public datasets, but coordinated efforts to transform government-held data into citizen-centred services and applications still lagged behind. By leveraging an existing network of civic developers, government change agents and open data enthusiasts, a growing civic tech community was cultivated, and its organizing force – Code for Germany was born.
    <p>
    </p>
    In one year, the Code for Germany has expanded from 8 cities to 20 across the Federal Republic. These local communities are made up of 300 volunteers that have put in more than 15.000 hours of civic hacking. A variety of apps and projects have been developed, from transforming municipal information systems into more democratic digital spaces, to improving access to pre-school education. Together, these local groups have fostered demand for more data, opening up an active dialogue between data users and city governments.</p>
