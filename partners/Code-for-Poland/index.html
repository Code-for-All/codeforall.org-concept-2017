    <h2>Program Description</h2>
    <p>Our vision is Poland as a country with efficient public institutions being citizen-centric, companies focused on social issues operating on public data, progressive NGOs knowing how to advocate with data, with citizens involving themselves more in public matters and finally with dialogue that builds trust among all of these actors.

    We believe that wise use of technology can help to achieve such state in Poland. We have divided our actions in three areas of action:
    Advocate - create dialogue with public institutions and NGOs, recommend them progressive open solutions like open data platforms and publishing procurement info, stimulate integration with various partners. 
    Create - build innovative social prototypes, applications and services. Repeat successes with deployment in other cities/areas. 
    Discuss - participate in discussions on our forum, on conferences. Propose new ideas, debate ones published by others.

    We act in mentioned areas through the network of formally confirmed partners - mostly local NGOs and hackerspaces, but also companies and city offices. </p>

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>Founding Story
    Since 2010 <a href="http://epf.org.pl/en/">ePaństwo Foundation</a> has been a leader in creating technological tools to support democracy and access to public information in Poland. We believe that new technologies should serve not only business but also empowerment of citizens. We believe that using tech skills for social benefit is a modern way of patriotism and should be promoted as such. We build a great product - it started as a parliamentary monitoring website and grew into the biggest repository of public data in Poland with various apps build on the data. At that point we felt ready to build a community of like-minded people to spread the idea of Coding for Poland. Than we discovered that there is Code for America and thanks to contact with CfA we gained a lot of inspiration on how to organise our community work.</p>
