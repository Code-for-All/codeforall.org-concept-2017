    <h2>Mission</h2>

    <p>Governments and authorities are facing major challenges. Citizens want to be informed and be able to use innovative services. Code for NL joins a global network of civic innovators who use technology to strengthen governments and increase citizen participation. 
     
    Code for NL puts innovative people with technical skills within (semi) governments to work on concrete solutions to social problems. In a program of one year these fellows work closely with all stakeholders surrounding the problem; they involve citizens, civil society organizations and government officials and use technology in a practical way. 

    </p>
    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>Code for NL has emerged from the Code for Europe project that the city of Amsterdam and Waag Society participated in over the past three years. Because the ideas behind the movement gained so much support we felt it was the right time to promote the fellowship idea beyond Amsterdam.        
    
    Currently we have three government bodies interested in running a fellowship this year: the City of Amsterdam, the City of Eindhoven and the Province of Groningen. Waag Society is responsible for setting up Code for NL, but we are looking for partners to help us spread the ideas and values.
