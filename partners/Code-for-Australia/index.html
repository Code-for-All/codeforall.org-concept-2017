    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>Alvaro Maz met Dan Groch in 2013 doing a startup leadership course in Melbourne. Whilst both were building their business, Dan had also started thinking about contextualising the Code for America model to Australia with Jacob Lindsay. The motivations of the group include doing things differently, making change, demonstrating things can happen and helping others succeed.</p>
