    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>Laboratorio para la Ciudad (Laboratory for the City) is Mexico City’s experimental office for civic innovation and urban creativity, the first city government department of its kind in Latin America. The Lab is a space for rethinking, reimagining, and reinventing the way citizens and government can work together towards a more open, more livable and more imaginative city.</p>
    <p>
    Mexico City’s Lab for the City was founded as a creative think-tank and experimental space for the government of Mexico City - the first of its kind at the city level in Latin America that brings together stakeholders within the civic tech space. It is the product of a partnership between an ambitious new Mayor and citizens committed to harnessing innovation to positively impact their city. The Lab’s primary staff is comprised of a multidisciplinary team of 20 people (artists, architects, urban planners, journalists, designers, historians, sociologists, techies, economists, etc.) and officially launched in June 2013. Working in a studio-like manner, the Lab environment fostered creativity and collaboration with an overarching strategy articulated as “provocations.”

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>
    Elected in 2012, Mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera founded the Laboratorio para la Ciudad (Mexico City Government Innovation Lab) to institutionalize innovation inside city government. It is run as a creative think tank and is home to CódigoCDMX (Code for Mexico City). CódigoCDMX recruited, trained and guided five skilled technologists to serve as fellows for a nine-month program in which they partnered with six Mexico City government departments. Working in partnership with these departments, they used technology to devise solutions to problems facing city residents.

            <p>With one of the most complex and fascinating cities in the whole world as a playground, Gabriella Gómez-Mont directs Laboratorio para la Ciudad, Mexico City’s new creative think-tank and experimental space. Laboratorio is a place to reflect about all things city and to ponder social scripts and urban futures for the largest megalopolis in the western hemisphere. Covering everything from the practical to the outlandish, the Laboratorio both explores immediate solutions for today and also examines the next 100 years of this city’s (and others cities’) life.
