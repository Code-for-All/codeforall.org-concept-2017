    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>Code for America believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use. We focus our iterative, user-centered, and data-driven approach to government primarily in four areas that have real human impact: Health, Economic Development, Safetly and Justice & Citizen-Government Interaction.

    Code for America helps show what's possible and changed tools, platforms, skills, and practices of government in hundreds of cities.
    <p>
    <b>Showing what’s possible</b><br>
    Digital government can cost less and work for the public. Showing what's possible is the first step. Then we spread the word.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Transitioning tools and platforms</b><br>
    Code for America brings technologists into government and supports new practices among existing teams to change how government delivers services.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Changing people and practices</b><br>
    Consumer technology gets better and cheaper every day. Government technology can too if cities and counties adopt tools and platforms that are built to move with the times.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Deepening impact</b><br>
    Code for America focuses our work in areas that have positive impact in people's lives.

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>In 2009, Code for America was founded by Jennifer Pahlka. The organization began by enlisting technology and design professionals to work with city governments in the United States in order to build open-source applications and promote openness, participation, and efficiency in government, and has grown into a cross-sector network of practitioners of civic innovation and a platform for "civic hacking." Code for America is one of the founding members of the Code for All network.</p>
