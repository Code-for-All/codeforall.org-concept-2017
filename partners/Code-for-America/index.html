    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>Code for America’s five programs – the Fellowship, the Brigade, the Peer Network, our Civic Startups program, and our International activities – produce a growing body of civic technology work.

    We create and deploy open-source software for local governments. We convene discussions around data formats for important issues such as restaurant ratings, housing code violations, transit, and trails. And we use the power of our network, across programs, to help cities tackle some of the most complex challenges they face.   

 </p>

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>In 2009, Code for America was founded by Jennifer Pahlka. The organization began by enlisting technology and design professionals to work with city governments in the United States in order to build open-source applications and promote openness, participation, and efficiency in government, and has grown into a cross-sector network of practitioners of civic innovation and a platform for "civic hacking."</p>
