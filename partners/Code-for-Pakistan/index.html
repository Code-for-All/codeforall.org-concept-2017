    <h2>Program Description</h2>

    <p>We are a tech non-profit that’s creating a non-partisan civic innovation ecosystem aiming to improve quality of life across Pakistan. Through the creation of open source technology to address civic needs, we strive to transform civic life by increasing civic engagement, encouraging the opening of government data, and supporting innovation in the public domain.</p>
    <p>
    Trust in civic institutions has eroded in Pakistan, and too many of our fellow citizens view government as bureaucratic, corrupt, and inefficient -- or worse, as something that stifles progress rather than as a potential force for good. Collaboration between citizen tech developers and domain experts in local governments can create civic solutions and enhance civic life. This starts to reframe the relationship between local government and citizens, which is essential if the two are to live together smartly towards building a progressive Pakistan.

    <h2>Founding Story</h2>
    <p>After nearly 7 years at Yahoo!, founder Sheba Najmi wanted to have a larger social impact. She discovered Code for America in 2011 and was fortunate to be selected as a 2012 Fellow. That year changed the course of her life path, and she knew she had to take her learnings to her native Pakistan where government was widely accepted as a failed institution. In early 2013, she returned to Pakistan and followed the Lean Startup methodology to test the hypothesis that there was interest in civic hacking in Pakistan by launching a very low-budget Karachi Civic Hackathon. The response was overwhelmingly positive and led to validation that citizens want to use their skills to innovate in public services. Code for Pakistan was born.</p>
