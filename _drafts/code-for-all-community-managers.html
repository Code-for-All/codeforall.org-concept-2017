<p>This untapped potential attracted my attention from the get go, prompting me to put constant effort in engaging my own community at Code4Romania in supporting the work of Code for All and by proposing and contributing to the adoption of various tools and mechanisms that would enable a closer cooperation. Right now,  Code for All has the opportunity to grow its capacity with a few part-time employees. I am a firm believer that this opportunity can be a veritable turning point towards at last efficiently tapping the potential of our joined communities. In a best case scenario, the Code for All members will by default exchange expertise, resources and exchange or work together on projects with regional or international impact. Such a scenario would not only help<br />
our various organizations, but would also benefit the worldwide civic hack movement.  As the largest civic hack community in the world, we need to grow to the challenge of having a true international presence which is felt and impactful. - Bogdan's</p>
