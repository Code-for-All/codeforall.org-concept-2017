        <p> This year Code for All will host its first public Summit to bring together the international community of civic hackers who believe government and civil society can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. We welcome everyone with an interest in how civic hacking communities grow, the kinds of influence we are having around the globe, and what needs to be done to accelerate our work.
