        New York, NY</center></h2>
        
        <p> This year Code for All will host its first public Summit to bring together the international community of civic hackers who believe government and civil society can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. We welcome everyone with an interest in how civic hacking communities grow, the kinds of influence we are having around the globe, and what needs to be done to accelerate our work.

            Understanding what change we want to make and how we know if we are achieving it is a challenge for all civic technology organizations. In this session we will discuss how How different Code for All partners define goals and measure impact and answer questions like:<br><br>
            <li>Are we making progress in moving beyond simply building apps to making structural changes in government?</li>
            <li>What tools and methods exist for tracking progress and how can they be incorporated into our work?</li>
            <li>What things should we be measuring collectively, to understand the overall impact of the Code for All movement?</li>

            Code for All has partners working in over a dozen countries around the world, each of which has unique problems and needs. In this session we will talk about how the basic Code-for model has been adopted in different political and cultural settings. We will address questions like:<br><br>
            <li>Which parts of the basic Code-for model (particularly the Fellowship and Brigade) translate well across political and cultural contexts?</li>
            <li>What innovations are different Code for All partners making on the original model? Which of those innovations shows promise to scale to other countries?</li>
            <li>What programming gaps have we identified that need to be filled, and how might we fill them?</li>

          <td><b>Panel #3 Making structural change in government.</b><br>
            Any successful Code for All program requires strong relationships be built with public-sector institutions. Building these relationships and developing trust with government partners is often the hardest part of our work. In this session Code for Pakistan, Australia and Poland will share learnings on how to build strong relationships with government partners and how to drive structural change within institutions. We will address questions such as:<br><br>
            <li>What incentivizes government to get involved with a Code-for program and how can we communicate the value proposition?</li>
            <li>How do we overcome common barriers like procurement or low tolerance for experimentation?</li>
            <li>How do we find the right partners within the institutions who will be the most effective collaborators?</li>
