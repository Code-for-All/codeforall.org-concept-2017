## Program Description

In it's first year Code for the Caribbean has teamed up with the Rural Area
Development Agency (RADA), a subsidiary of the Ministry of Agriculture, to
launch a pilot Fellowship Program. The first cohort of CftC Fellows will
comprise of passionate developers, designers and entrepreneurs who will work
alongside government partners to improve public services.<br><br>

A Caribbean first, the pilot CftC Fellowship offers 3 part-time positions for a
6 month period. Fellows will work alongside RADA to explore inventive solutions
for combating praedial larceny, one of the leading problems plaguing the Jamaican
agricultural industry. By collaborating with stakeholders within and outside
the Ministry, Fellows will build at least one application designed to
address this problem area.

This pilot is fully-funded, and chosen Fellows will receive a stipend for their work.

## Founding Story
In December 2012, SlashRoots started conversations with Reboot, a social impact
firm dedicated to inclusive development and accountable governance, and the
Mona School of Business and Management (MSBM) at the University of the West
Indies about starting a Fellowship program. After initial expressions of support,
Matthew McNaughton, Executive Director at SlashRoots Foundation, began working
with Jeremy Canfield, a 2011 Code for America Fellow who was a Service
Designer at Reboot at that time. Together, they began to draft the CftC G
uide for Launching Innovation Fellowships. This Guide was intended to direct
the design and implementation of the CftC fellowship pilot, and to assist
others interested in starting their own Fellowship programs.
