Code for America believes government can work for the people, by the people in
the 21st century.
<!--more-->

We build open source technology and organize a network of
people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to
use. We focus our iterative, user-centered, and data-driven approach to
government primarily in four areas that have real human impact:
Health, Economic Development, Safety and Justice & Citizen-Government
Interaction. Code for America helps show what's possible and changed tools,
platforms, skills, and practices of government in hundreds of cities.
