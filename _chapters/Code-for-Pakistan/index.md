To elevate the quality of civic life in Pakistan.
<!--more-->

## Program Description

We are a tech non-profit that’s creating a non-partisan civic innovation ecosystem
aiming to improve quality of life across Pakistan. Through the creation of open
source technology to address civic needs, we strive to transform civic life by
increasing civic engagement, encouraging the opening of government data, and
supporting innovation in the public domain.

Trust in civic institutions has eroded in Pakistan, and too many of our fellow
citizens view government as bureaucratic, corrupt, and inefficient -- or worse,
as something that stifles progress rather than as a potential force for good.
Collaboration between citizen tech developers and domain experts in local
governments can create civic solutions and enhance civic life. This starts to
reframe the relationship between local government and citizens, which is
essential if the two are to live together smartly towards building a
progressive Pakistan.

## Founding Story

After nearly 7 years at Yahoo!, founder Sheba Najmi wanted to have a larger
social impact. She discovered Code for America in 2011 and was fortunate to be
selected as a 2012 Fellow. That year changed the course of her life path, and
she knew she had to take her learnings to her native Pakistan where government
was widely accepted as a failed institution. In early 2013, she returned to
Pakistan and followed the Lean Startup methodology to test the hypothesis that
there was interest in civic hacking in Pakistan by launching a very low-budget
Karachi Civic Hackathon. The response was overwhelmingly positive and led to
validation that citizens want to use their skills to innovate in public
services. Code for Pakistan was born.
