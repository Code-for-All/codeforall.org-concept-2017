## Program Description

Code for South Africa (Code4SA) is a non-­profit civic technology organisation.
Our goal is to promote informed decision­-making, especially for social good.

Our objectives are four-­fold:

* Strengthen the demand-­side for open data by growing existing open data communities
* Promote institutional change within media, civil-­society organisations and government through direct engagement as well as from within by encouraging individuals within those organisations to participate in open data communities
* Promote the opening up of government data
* Providing technical support to civil society organisations to create civic technologies that can make data more meaningfol and facilitate citizens to engage with government

## Founding Story

Established in October 2013 with an African News Innovation Challenge (ANIC)
grant to foster data­-journalism, Code4SA has developed a strong brand in the
civil society and media spaces. We are widely recognised as leaders in civic
technology and data journalism and are starting to make an impact in government
circles around open data.

_Everyone has the right of access to any information held by the state; and any
information that is held by another person and that is required for the exercise
 or protection of any rights._
