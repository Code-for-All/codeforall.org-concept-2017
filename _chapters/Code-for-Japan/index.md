## Program Description

Code for Japan is connecting citizens and governments. For supporting citizens, we are building local Code for communities. On the government side, we are running fellowship program for changing the government from inside of it.

## Founding Story
Hal Seki, a founder of Code for Japan, started Code for Japan in June 2013. Since 2011, Hal has been a technology activist in the open data movement after leading some projects that supported the people injured by the massive earthquake which occurred in the Tohoku region of Japan. It was then that he realized the real value of the open data movement. Open data is not just about data but a way to create an open community with the people who want to make the world better with governments. In May 2013, he went to the Personal Democracy Forum to discuss the possibility of starting Code for Japan with Catherine Bracy. With Catherine’s encouragement, he kicked of Code for Japan with the same people who were gathered at the first meeting.
