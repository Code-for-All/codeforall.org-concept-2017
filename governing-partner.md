### Governing partner

The governing partners of Code for All are comprised of the partners in the organization who make decisions about the network’s strategy, activities and growth.

New applicants desiring to become a governing partner of Code for All will be evaluated by current governing partners based on the applicant’s level of organizational maturity.

### Process for Consideration

Every quarter, affiliate partners are given the opportunity to indicate interest in applying as a governing partner of Code for All. During these windows, interested affiliates send an email indicating interest to the Code for All secretariat. The application process includes the following steps and should typically not take longer than eight weeks:

1. The Code for All secretariat will respond to applicants who are determined to meet the established criteria for membership as a governing partner to organize an initial interview call with a member of the partnership committee. This committee member will serve as the applicant’s point of contact throughout the consideration process.
2. The applicant’s point of contact will take the lead in conducting a review of the organization to ensure that the organization meets the criteria for being a governing partner.
3. Based on this review, the Applicant’s point of contact will deliver initial recommendations to the full partnership committee on whether the applicant should be considered for membership as a governing partner.
4. The partnership committee may request any additional information that might assist in the decisionmaking process.
5. Applicants that meet the established criteria and are recommended for full membership as a governing partner by the partnership committee are put to a vote before the all governing partners of Code for All. Affirmative decisions must be made unanimously by those governing partners that choose to vote. Any objections raised should be resolved.

Applicants receive additional instructions on whether they’ve been accepted for full membership as a governing partner, deferred or denied. New governing partners will be asked to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Code for All network.
